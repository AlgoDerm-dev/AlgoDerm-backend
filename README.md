# AlgoDerm-backend
Contains back end logic for AlgoDerm, including RESTful API, Python Machine Learning/AI tools, and Django database support.

## Project Synopsis
Development of machine learning imaging algorithms that are able to recognize and classify skin tags and moles, including cancerous formations.
A database will be developed that will hold temporal data of patients skin scans (cloud based hosting), basic skin scan imaging solutions (based on existing methods), and a web based interface to access and update the data. The module should allow to compare progression of tagged (problem) regions from previous scans. 

## Motivation
Moles, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma are the most commonly referred types of skin problems that affect current population. Identification of these skin problems is currently done in specialist offices, often with long waiting times and with a relatively high cost. 
Medical imaging has progressed to the point where one can discern the 3D organization of chromosomes within a single cell. 
It is then timely that algorithms are developed for automated identification of major skin problems, that can then be inspected online by qualified medical practitioners
